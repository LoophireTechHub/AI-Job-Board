## ü§ñ AI Integration Details

### Question Generation Flow
1. **Trigger**: Job status changes to "active" (create or update)
2. **Check**: Verifies no active questions already exist
3. **Generate**: Calls Claude API with job details
4. **Parse**: Extracts JSON response with questions
5. **Store**: Saves to `question_templates` table
6. **Error Handling**: Non-blocking async with error logging

### Question Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  job_id: string;
  questions: [
    {
      id: string;
      text: string;
      type: 'behavioral' | 'technical' | 'scenario';
      lookingFor: string[];
      followUp: string;
      scoringKeywords: string[];
      weight: 1-5;
    }
  ];
  evaluation_criteria: {
    technical_skills: string[];
    soft_skills: string[];
    culture_fit: string[];
    min_score_threshold: number;
  };
  question_version: number;
  is_active: boolean;
  generated_at: string;
}
```
