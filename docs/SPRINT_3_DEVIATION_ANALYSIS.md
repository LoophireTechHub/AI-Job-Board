# Sprint 3 Deviation Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Post-Mortem

---

## What Went Wrong

### Root Cause
**Complete misalignment with product vision** - Built a traditional application form instead of the core conversational AI interview experience.

---

## Detailed Comparison

### What Was Built ‚ùå

**Form-Based Application Flow**:

1. **Application Form Page** (`/jobs/[id]/apply/page.tsx`)
   - Traditional HTML form
   - Fields: name, email, phone, LinkedIn URL, portfolio
   - Resume file upload (drag & drop)
   - Cover letter textarea
   - Submit button
   - Zod validation on submit
   - POST to `/api/jobs/[id]/apply`

2. **Application API** (`/app/api/jobs/[id]/apply/route.ts`)
   - Receives form data
   - Validates with Zod
   - Stores in `applications` table
   - Triggers async resume parsing
   - Returns success/error

3. **Resume Upload** (`/lib/storage/resume-upload.ts`)
   - File validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX, 5MB limit)
   - Upload to Supabase Storage
   - Generate public URL
   - Return path

4. **Resume Parser** (`/lib/ai/resume-parser.ts`)
   - Extract text from file
   - Send to Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - Parse JSON response
   - Store in `applications.resume_parsed_data` (JSONB)

5. **Company Dashboard** (`/app/dashboard/applications/`)
   - List all applications
   - Filter by job, status, search
   - View application details
   - See parsed resume data
   - Update status via dropdown

**Total Files Created**: 26 files
**Total Lines of Code**: ~3,000 lines
**Story Points Equivalent**: ~30 SP of work

---

### What Should Have Been Built ‚úÖ

**Conversational AI Interview Flow**:

1. **Chat Interface** (`/components/interview/chat-interface.tsx`)
   - Message bubbles (user/AI)
   - Typing indicators
   - Progress bar
   - Send button
   - Auto-scroll

2. **Interview Session API** (`/app/api/interview-session/route.ts`)
   - POST - Start interview session
   - PUT - Submit answer, get next question
   - GET - Retrieve session state
   - Manage conversation_history (JSONB)

3. **Conversation Manager** (`/lib/ai/conversation-manager.ts`)
   - startInterview() - Generate greeting + first question
   - processAnswer() - Analyze response, determine next step
   - generateFollowUp() - Create contextual follow-up
   - concludeInterview() - Closing message + summary

4. **Interview Application Page** (`/app/jobs/[id]/apply/page.tsx`)
   - Resume upload (optional)
   - Start interview button
   - Full-screen chat interface
   - Session persistence
   - Resume later functionality

5. **Company Interview Review** (`/app/dashboard/applications/[id]/interview/page.tsx`)
   - Full conversation transcript
   - AI analysis per answer
   - Individual scores
   - Overall assessment
   - Export transcript

**Expected Files**: ~12 files
**Expected Lines of Code**: ~2,500 lines
**Expected Story Points**: 42 SP

## Why the Deviation Happened

### Factors Contributing to Error

1. **Didn't Review Product Vision First**
   - Jumped straight into implementation
   - Assumed "application form" = traditional form
   - Didn't check README.md or PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md

2. **Ignored Existing API Documentation**
   - `docs/API.md` clearly defines `/api/interview-session` endpoints
   - Didn't reference `interview_sessions` table in schema
   - Missed "conversational" references throughout docs

3. **Followed Common Pattern Instead of Product Spec**
   - Built what's "normal" for job applications
   - Didn't question why this product is different
   - Defaulted to familiar implementation

4. **No Validation with User**
   - Didn't present plan for approval before coding
   - Didn't confirm Sprint 3 scope
   - Assumed understanding was correct

---

## Impact Assessment

### Time Lost
- **2 days** building wrong features
- **~30 SP** of wasted effort
- **26 files** to refactor/remove

### Technical Debt Created
- Application form code needs removal
- Database has unused form submissions
- Inconsistent candidate experience

### Positive Outcomes
- Resume parser works (can reuse)
- File upload logic solid (can reuse)
- Company dashboard partially correct

---

## Lessons Learned

### Process Improvements Needed

1. **ALWAYS Review Product Docs First**
   - Read README.md
   - Check PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md
   - Review API.md
   - Check database schema
   - Understand unique value props

2. **Present Plan Before Implementation**
   - Create detailed sprint plan
   - Get user approval
   - Confirm architecture
   - Validate against product vision

3. **Question Assumptions**
   - If something seems "too normal", verify
   - Check if product has unique approach
   - Understand differentiators

4. **Reference Existing Specs**
   - Database schema
   - API documentation
   - Type definitions
   - Previous sprint learnings

### New Sprint Workflow

**Before Starting Any Sprint**:
1. ‚úÖ Read all product documentation
2. ‚úÖ Review database schema for that sprint
3. ‚úÖ Check API.md for endpoints
4. ‚úÖ Create detailed plan
5. ‚úÖ **Get user approval on plan**
6. ‚úÖ Begin implementation

**During Sprint**:
1. ‚úÖ Daily progress updates
2. ‚úÖ Validate approach with user
3. ‚úÖ Reference docs frequently
4. ‚úÖ Test against product vision

---

## Corrective Actions Taken

1. ‚úÖ Created `SPRINT_3_CORRECTED_PLAN.md`
2. ‚úÖ Documented deviation in this file
3. ‚úÖ Presented corrected plan to user
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Awaiting approval to proceed with correct implementation

## Reusable Components

Despite the deviation, these components can be reused:

### Backend (Can Reuse)
‚úÖ `lib/storage/resume-upload.ts` - For optional resume upload
‚úÖ `lib/storage/resume-validation.ts` - File validation
‚úÖ `lib/ai/resume-parser.ts` - Resume parsing logic
‚úÖ `app/api/applications/[id]/route.ts` - GET, PATCH, DELETE
‚úÖ `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - LinkedIn OAuth

### Frontend (Can Reuse)
‚úÖ `components/applications/application-card.tsx` - Application list
‚úÖ `components/applications/status-update.tsx` - Status dropdown
‚úÖ `app/dashboard/applications/page.tsx` - Application list
‚úÖ `app/dashboard/applications/[id]/page.tsx` - Detail view (modify)

### To Discard
‚ùå `components/applications/application-form.tsx` - Replace with chat
‚ùå `app/jobs/[id]/apply/page.tsx` - Replace entirely
‚ùå `app/api/jobs/[id]/apply/route.ts` - Replace with interview-session

---

## Moving Forward

### Immediate Next Steps

1. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Get approval** on SPRINT_3_CORRECTED_PLAN.md
2. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Archive wrong files** (move to `/archive` folder)
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Start fresh** with conversational AI implementation
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Create GitHub issues** for correct Sprint 3 plan
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Daily check-ins** to ensure alignment

### Quality Gates

Before merging ANY PR:
- ‚úÖ Does this align with product vision?
- ‚úÖ Does this match the documented API?
- ‚úÖ Does this use the correct database tables?
- ‚úÖ Is this mentioned in README.md or PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md?

---

## Commitment

**I will NEVER skip the planning and approval step again.**

Every sprint will now follow:
1. Research ‚Üí 2. Plan ‚Üí 3. **Approval** ‚Üí 4. Implement

No exceptions.
